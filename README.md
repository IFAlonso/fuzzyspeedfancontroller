This is the design of a control system to manage the fan speed using a BME280 temperature and humidity sensor  along with the radar sensor RCWL-0516. This speed fan controller is created based on fuzzy logic to produce a PWM output signal provided by the ESP32 microcontroller unit. The fuzzy algorithm and MCU were programmed under MicroPython language.
