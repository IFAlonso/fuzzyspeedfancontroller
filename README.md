This is the design of a control system to manage a fan speed using a BME280 temperature and humidity sensor along with the radar sensor RCWL-0516. This speed fan controller is based on fuzzy logic (Mamdani fuzzy inference method) to produce a PWM output signal provided by the ESP32 microcontroller unit. The fuzzy algorithm and MCU were programmed under the MicroPython language.
